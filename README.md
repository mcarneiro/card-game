# Card Game (WIP)

This project is my playground for React and Socket.io. I created the game based on the mini card game I designed for an event that's described [on this post (brazillian portuguese only)](https://medium.com/@mcarneiro/a-busca-pelo-trabalho-%C3%A1gil-em-ag%C3%AAncia-de-publicidade-6838580edad5).

It is WIP and for now is just bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

From the project folder:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
